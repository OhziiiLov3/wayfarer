# Project Wayfarer- General Assembelers (Richard, Josh, Kimo, Ohz)

## Brief
We have been commissioned to build a travel community, code-named Project Wayfarer for now, for users to share tips (AKA posts) about their favorite locations around the world.

### Client Contract 
- The client has provided basic wireframes and user stories. In some cases, these requirements may be vague or incomplete.
